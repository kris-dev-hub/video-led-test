I want to make a program with pio that will blink the onboard LED in blue. Turn it on for three seconds and then off for one.
The board is in /dev/ttyACM0 , if you need me to reset it or flash it please tell me.
Use espidf framework. The diode number and details are in documentation. Check if selected board is correct, has the same amount of ram.

Upload the code to the board and test it, if it works tell me.
Repeat until it works.
Make sure to include all necessary libraries and configurations for the ESP32-S3 board.
